# Recreate The Google Homepage Project

This project will teach you to recreate the Google Homepage. Don't worry if the links don't go anywhere and the search box doesn't do anything when you submit it. THe goal is to start thinking about how elements get placed on the page and roughly how they get styled and aligned.
